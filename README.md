# Local Extrema Of Imperative Programs

Features code that implements and tests an algorithm for finding local extrema of imperative programs.

Masters thesis of Matthew Sj√∂din for Computer Science at Oxford, 2016.

Main.java contains some examples of how to use the algorithm, which times how fast it is in reality.

Masters thesis itself containing the algorithm implemented is in the top level of the repository.

To open in IntelliJ, clone the repository and run `./gradlew idea` in the top level to generate the IntelliJ project, then open the `.ipr` file generated.

Tests are written in Spock, and are probably more interesting to look at that the (similar) analysis done in Main.java.
